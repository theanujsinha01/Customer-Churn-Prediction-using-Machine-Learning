# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning ðŸš€

This project predicts customer churn (i.e., whether a customer will leave the company or not) based on customer usage behavior and services. It uses machine learning models trained on the popular Telco Customer Churn dataset.

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

The goal is to build a machine learning model to:
- Predict whether a customer will **churn (leave)** or **stay**.
- Use features like gender, services subscribed, tenure, charges, etc.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Info

- Source: IBM Sample Dataset
- Records: 7043
- Features: 19 input features + target `Churn` (Yes/No)

## âœ… Workflow Summary

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Missing value handling
   - Label Encoding (`label_encoders.pkl`)
   - Feature selection

2. **Model Training**
   - SMOTE applied to balance classes
   - Random Forest used as final model
   - Cross-validation applied for accuracy check

3. **Model Saving**
   - `random_forest_model.pkl` for model
   - `label_encoders.pkl` for encoders

4. **Prediction Pipeline**
   - Load model + encoders
   - Take new customer input
   - Predict churn
